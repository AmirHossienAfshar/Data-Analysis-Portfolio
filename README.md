# Data Analysis Learning Journey

## Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Amir Hossein Afshar, and I am deeply passionate about learning data analysis. This repository serves as a documentation of my journey as I develop my skills in data analysis, working through various datasets and analytical techniques.

## Purpose

This repository is not just a personal project but also a resource for others who might be on a similar path. Here, you'll find Jupyter notebooks that reflect my learning process, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to more advanced topics as I continue to grow my knowledge.

## Contents

The notebooks included in this repository are:
- **Introduction to Data Analysis**: An overview of basic data analysis concepts and techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of datasets to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.

Each notebook is well-documented, with explanations and insights provided at each step. I hope that these resources will be beneficial to others, whether you're just starting out or looking to enhance your own understanding of data analysis.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks on your local machine:
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmirHossienAfshar/Data-Analysis-Portfolio
    ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Data-Analysis-Portfolio
    ```
3. **Install the required packages**:
    - You may need to install specific Python libraries, such as `pandas` and `numpy`.
    - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
4. **Open the notebooks**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Select the notebook you'd like to explore from the Jupyter interface.

## Contributing

Since this repository is a reflection of my learning process, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions. If you have ideas for improving the notebooks or notice something that could be done better, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Conclusion

This repository is a work in progress, and I am continuously learning and updating it with new insights and analyses. I hope that my documentation will not only demonstrate my growth in data analysis but also serve as a helpful resource for others.

Thank you for visiting, and happy analyzing!
